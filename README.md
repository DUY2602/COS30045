This project was developed with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, specifically in:

- UI/UX Styling: Assist in writing and optimizing CSS layouts, including responsive design and custom component styling.

- Debugging & Issue Resolution: Help identify logical errors in JavaScript and provide efficient solutions for cross-browser compatibility issues.

Although GitHub Copilot provided code suggestions, all logic was reviewed and tested to ensure accuracy and compliance with project requirements.
